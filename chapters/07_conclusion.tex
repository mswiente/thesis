\section{Summary of the Research project}

\section{Contributions}

\section{Limitations}

Limitations of the concept for an \emph{Adaptive Middlware}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Only a single processing pattern is implemented
	\item Integrated services need to be changed to support batch and single event processing
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Integration of Off-the-shelf components difficult
	\end{itemize}
	\item Only a single adaption pattern is considered in the adaptive middleware concept and protoype implementation.
\end{itemize}

Limitations of the research prototype:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Impact of different controller architectures have not been exhaustivley analysed and researched. Only two controller architectures have been implemented. 
\end{itemize}

Limitations of the \emph{Conceptual Framework}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The services integrated by the prototype do not implement any further optimisations for batch processing. They use the same implementation for batch and single-event processing. Thus, the impact of batch optimisations has not been investigated.
	\item The \emph{Conceptual Framework} has not been validated, for example by qualitative research methods, such as expert interviews are applied with real-life projects.
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Work}

Based on the limitations of this research, as described in the previous section, the following open issues could be adressed by future work.

\begin{itemize}
	\item System consisting of multiple Aggregators and input queues
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Does this approach still work with the proposed control strategy (every aggregator optimizes the aggregation size independently)?
		\item Is a different approach better or even necessary? For example a central control strategy?
	\end{itemize}
	\item Add a figure for illustration
	\item Support for different messaging patterns such as Publish/Subscribe
	\item Extending the middleware concept to support different adaption patterns, such as dynamic service composition and selection and load balancing.
	\item Validation of the \emph{Conceptual Framework} by qualitative research methods or in real-life projects
\end{itemize}
