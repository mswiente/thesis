\section{Contributions}

\section{Limitations}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Only a single processing pattern is implemented
	\item Integrated services need to be changed to support batch and single event processing
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Integration of Off-the-shelf components difficult
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
	\item System consisting of multiple Aggregators and input queues
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Does this approach still work with the proposed control strategy (every aggregator optimizes the aggregation size independently)?
		\item Is a different approach better or even necessary? For example a central control strategy?
	\end{itemize}
	\item Add a figure for illustration
	\item Support for different messaging patterns such as Publish/Subscribe
\end{itemize}
